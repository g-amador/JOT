Note that the jogl-demos.jar, which contains the GearsApplet class,
<B>does not need to be signed</B>! JogAmp Community signs
jogl-all.jar and gluegen-rt.jar, which contain the
JOGL's supporting classes; this is the only
Java code which needs to be signed in order to deploy applets using
JOGL and is the only certificate the end user must accept.
</del><br/>
Sadly, due to Oracle's Java Applet Plugin update 7u51,
unsigned applets are no more allowed and effectively 
lower the bar to create user applets with raised privileges.<br/>
Hence JogAmp Community <b>signs</b> jogl-all.jar and gluegen-rt.jar, which contain the
JOGL's supporting classes as well as jogl-demos.jar, which contains the GearsApplet class.<br/>
jogl-demos.jar's manifest file uses <i>Permissions: sandbox</i>
to <b>not raise privileges</b>.
